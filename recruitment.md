# Recruitment #

## State of the project ##

As you noticed, there is still a lot of work to do on the project:

* The website looks terrible ([more](https://github.com/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io/issues/2))
* It should provide more features ([more](https://github.com/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io/issues/4))
* The addon isn't really convenient to use ([more](https://github.com/ws-armory/Armory/issues/3))

I really have a lack of skills in some domains (UI designing as you should have noticed ;)) and I'll probably have a lack of time in the next months.

That's pretty much why I'm currently looking for some people to create a team to work on and maintain this project.


## We need you ! ##

If you have some skills in **Web design** and **Web development** (JavaScript for the moment) you'll probably be interested by the [ws-armory.github.io project](http://github.io/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io).

If you have some skills in **Wildstar addons development** you'll probably be interested by the [Armory project](http://github.io/ws-armory/Armory).


## Contributing ##

If you have some time and you want to take part of the adventure, just [contact me](http://github.com/olbat) or create some [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to propose your improvements.

If you're not familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and/or [Github](https://try.github.io/) and you're not familiar with [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), do not hesitate to [contact me](http://github.com/olbat) to get some help.


## Contact ##

At anytime I'll be happy to discuss with you and answer your questions on the [project's chatroom](http://gitter.im/ws-armory/chat/~chat), it's also possible to create feature/bug requests via Github ([for the website](https://github.com/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io/issues), [for the addon](https://github.com/ws-armory/Armory/issues)).
